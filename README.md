# iPlanner
We created a GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) for the app to look neatly designed. We used 
C++ for logic, SQLite3 for data storage, Qt creator for GUI and compilation. We created a 
signup page for users to enter their details which will be stored in a database. Then login 
page verifies these details and gives the user permission to add or delete events.
